Fire Object Detection System for Kites using YOLOv10n ðŸ”¥ðŸ’ª
This project showcases a fire object detection system developed using the powerful YOLOv10n model. I spent considerable time building a custom dataset, fine-tuning it to accurately detect kites, especially during the vibrant Utrayan festival. With YOLOv10n's speed and precision, this system identifies objects in real-time from video feeds.

Key Features:
Custom Dataset: Created from scratch, tailored for optimal kite detection. âœ¨
YOLOv10n: Leveraging the power of YOLO for fast and accurate object detection. âœ…
Tech Meets Tradition: Applying cutting-edge AI to enhance the traditional Utrayan festival experience. ðŸ¦…

Project Walkthrough:
The code utilizes OpenCV and Supervision libraries to process video input and detect objects with YOLOv10n. The custom model (best.pt) is used to identify kites and annotate the video with bounding boxes and labels in real-time.
